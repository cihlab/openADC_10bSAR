# Open Analog-to-Digital-Converter Using RAIL AMS Framework
# An 10b 60-80MSps SAR ADC on 65nm CMOS Technology


## Project Dependency
The work was based on Chixiao's previous work experience on DARPA POSH project -- RAIL (Resilient Analog Instance Library and Language).
The original RAIL project is shown in [RAIL](https://github.com/rail-posh/rail65).
